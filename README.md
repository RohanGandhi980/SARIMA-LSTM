# SARIMA-LSTM
This project compares SARIMA and LSTM for time series forecasting. SARIMA models seasonality, while LSTM captures non-linear patterns. A hybrid approach combining LSTM and SARIMA can be used to solve complex models and real world applications like stock prediction, weather and temperature fluctuations.
